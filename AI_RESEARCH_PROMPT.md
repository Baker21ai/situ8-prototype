# AI Agent Research Prompt for Claude

## üéØ Research Mission

You are a senior AI consultant and compliance expert. I need you to research and analyze implementing an AI agent for a security operations platform called Situ8. Provide a comprehensive analysis covering technical implementation, compliance requirements, and legal considerations.

## üìã Context: What Situ8 Does

Situ8 is a security operations platform that manages:
- **Incident Management**: Security breaches, medical emergencies, fire alarms
- **Activity Tracking**: Security patrols, visitor management, equipment monitoring
- **Audit Trails**: Complete "WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY" logging
