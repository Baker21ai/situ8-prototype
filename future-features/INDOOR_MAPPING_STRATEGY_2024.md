}> = ({ floorPlanUrl, assets }) => {
  const bounds = [[0, 0], [100, 100]] as L.LatLngBoundsExpression;
  
  return (
    <MapContainer
      center={[50, 50]}
      zoom={1}
      bounds={bounds}
      className="h-full w-full"
    >
      <ImageOverlay url={floorPlanUrl} bounds={bounds} />
      {assets.map(asset => (
        <Marker 
          key={asset.id}
          position={[asset.position.y, asset.position.x]}
          icon={getAssetIcon(asset.type)}
        />
      ))}
    </MapContainer>
  );
};
```

**Advantages:**
- Open source (no licensing costs)
- Mature, stable technology
- Large community support
- Professional mapping features

**Disadvantages:**
- No AI processing
- Requires significant customization
- Limited 3D capabilities
- Manual coordinate system setup

### Fallback Option 3: Hybrid Manual + AI
**If AI processing is unreliable but we want some automation**

#### Semi-Automated Approach
```typescript
const HybridFloorPlanProcessor: React.FC = () => {
  const [processingMode, setProcessingMode] = useState<'ai' | 'manual'>('ai');
  
  const handleProcessing = async (file: File) => {
    if (processingMode === 'ai') {
      try {
        return await processWithAI(file);
      } catch (error) {
        console.warn('AI processing failed, falling back to manual');
        setProcessingMode('manual');
        return await processManually(file);
      }
    }
    
    return await processManually(file);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="hybrid-processor">
      <ProcessingModeSelector 
        mode={processingMode}
        onChange={setProcessingMode}
      />
      <FileUpload onUpload={handleProcessing} />
      <ManualEditingTools />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Best of Both Worlds:**
- AI when it works, manual when it doesn't
- Graceful degradation
- Customer choice of processing method
- Fallback for edge cases
