# Compliance Requirements Analysis for Situ8 AI Agent

## Executive Summary

Implementing an AI agent for Situ8 requires compliance with three major frameworks: SOC 2 Type II (mandatory for enterprise customers), ISO 27001:2022 (international standard), and NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (federal requirement). **Good news**: AWS Bedrock is already compliant with these standards, significantly reducing implementation complexity.

## SOC 2 Type II Compliance (Critical Priority)

### What is SOC 2 Type II?
