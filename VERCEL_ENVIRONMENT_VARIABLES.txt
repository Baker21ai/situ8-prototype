HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
=====================================

MOCK MODE (Immediate Solution):
- Shows fake security data (activities, incidents, cases)
- Each user sees the same demo data
- No real database needed
- Works immediately after adding variables above
- Good for demos and testing

PRODUCTION MODE (Real System):
- Connects to AWS Cognito for user accounts
- All users in your organization see the same real data
- Data is stored in AWS DynamoDB databases
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Requires AWS services to be set up and running

=====================================
ADDING COLLEAGUES
=====================================

IN MOCK MODE:
- App shows demo users
- Can't actually add real people
- Good for showing how it works

IN PRODUCTION MODE:
1. You create user accounts in AWS Cognito
2. Assign roles: Admin, Security Officer, Developer, Viewer
3. Set clearance levels (1-5)
4. Send invite emails
5. They log in and see the same organizational data
6. All actions are tracked in audit logs

=====================================
SHARED DATA EXPLANATION
=====================================

When AWS is enabled, everyone in your organization:
- Sees the same security activities in real-time
- Can collaborate on incidents and cases
- Receives real-time updates via WebSocket
- Has role-based access (some can view, others can edit)
- All changes are tracked with who did what

It's like Google Docs but for security operations:
- Multiple people can work together
- Everyone sees updates instantly
- Access is controlled by roles
- Full audit trail of all actions

=====================================
STEPS TO SUCCESS
=====================================

1. IMMEDIATE FIX (5 minutes):
   - Add the MOCK MODE variables above to Vercel
   - Redeploy
   - App will work with demo data

2. LATER - FULL SYSTEM (requires AWS setup):
   - Set up AWS services (Cognito, DynamoDB, Lambda)
   - Switch environment variables to PRODUCTION MODE
   - Create user accounts for colleagues
   - Start using with real data

=====================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
=====================================

- Mock mode is just for demos - no data is saved
- Production mode requires AWS account and setup
- Switching from mock to production is just changing environment variables
- All colleagues need accounts in AWS Cognito to access production
- The app is designed for 24/7 security operations centers
