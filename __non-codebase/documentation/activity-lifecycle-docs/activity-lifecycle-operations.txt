STATUS WORKFLOW - ACTIVITIES
-----------------------------
[DETECTING] → [ASSIGNED] → [RESPONDING] → [RESOLVED]

Officer Permissions:
• Can only move forward (detecting → resolved)
• Cannot move backwards
• Can add notes and evidence

Supervisor Permissions:
• Can move any direction
• Can reassign to different officers
• Must approve backwards movements from resolved

STATUS WORKFLOW - INCIDENTS
----------------------------
[PENDING] → [ACTIVE] → [INVESTIGATING] → [RESOLVED]
    ↓
[DISMISSED]

⚠️ ALL INCIDENTS START AS PENDING - YOU MUST VALIDATE!

================================================================================
                        GUARD/OFFICER PROCEDURES
================================================================================

CREATING AN ACTIVITY
--------------------
1. Click "New Activity" button
2. Select type (medical, security-breach, etc.)
3. Fill required fields:
   - Title: Brief description (e.g., "Unauthorized person at Gate 3")
   - Location: Specific location/building/zone
   - Priority: Leave default unless critical
   - Description: Detailed observations
4. Submit → System auto-creates PENDING incident

RESPONDING TO ACTIVITIES
------------------------
When Assigned to You:
1. Review activity details
2. Change status to "RESPONDING"
3. Proceed to location
4. Update with findings:
   - Add photos/videos as evidence
   - Update description with observations
   - Change status to "RESOLVED" when complete

Important Notes:
• Update status BEFORE going to location
• Add evidence IMMEDIATELY upon collection
• If situation escalates, change priority to HIGH/CRITICAL

================================================================================
                        SUPERVISOR PROCEDURES
================================================================================

VALIDATING PENDING INCIDENTS
-----------------------------
⏰ YOU HAVE 5 MINUTES TO REVIEW BEFORE AUTO-ESCALATION

1. Check "Pending Incidents" dashboard
2. Review each pending incident:
   
   APPROVE if:
   • Legitimate security concern
   • Requires response/investigation
   • Pattern of similar events
   
   DISMISS if:
   • False positive
   • Duplicate report
   • Non-security issue
   
   ESCALATE if:
   • Beyond your authority
   • Requires executive decision
   • Multi-site coordination needed

3. Add validation notes for audit trail

MANAGING ACTIVE INCIDENTS
--------------------------
1. Assign responding officers
2. Monitor real-time updates
3. Coordinate with dispatch
4. Request additional resources if needed
5. Ensure evidence collection
6. Review and close when resolved

ESCALATION MATRIX
-----------------
PRIORITY     INITIAL RESPONSE    ESCALATE TO         ESCALATE AFTER
Critical     Immediate          Duty Manager         5 minutes
High         5 minutes          Supervisor           10 minutes
Medium       10 minutes         Supervisor           20 minutes
Low          As available       N/A                  N/A

================================================================================
                        COMMON SCENARIOS
================================================================================

SCENARIO: Medical Emergency
---------------------------
1. Guard creates MEDICAL activity → Auto-creates CRITICAL incident
2. Supervisor IMMEDIATELY validates (no 5-minute wait for medical)
3. Dispatch emergency services
4. Assign closest guard to assist
5. Document everything for liability

SCENARIO: Suspicious Person
----------------------------
1. Guard creates SECURITY-BREACH activity
2. System creates PENDING incident (HIGH priority)
3. Supervisor reviews camera footage
4. If legitimate threat → APPROVE and dispatch
5. If employee without badge → DISMISS as false positive

SCENARIO: Multiple Related Activities
-------------------------------------
1. System auto-clusters similar activities
2. Creates single incident for pattern
3. Supervisor sees "3 related activities" flag
4. Review pattern for coordinated threat
5. Escalate if pattern suggests larger issue

SCENARIO: After-Hours Alert
---------------------------
1. Sensor triggers auto-create activity
2. Tagged as "after-hours" automatically
3. Higher false-positive likelihood
4. Check cameras before dispatching
5. May dismiss if wildlife/weather cause

================================================================================
                        QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

"I can't change status backwards"
→ Only supervisors can reverse status. Request supervisor assistance.

"Incident disappeared from my queue"
→ Check if auto-escalated after timeout. Check escalation queue.

"Can't see evidence attachments"
→ Check network connection. Evidence loads separately from text.

"Multiple incidents for same event"
→ System will auto-merge related incidents. Wait 30 seconds.

"Wrong priority assigned"
→ Supervisors can override. Request priority change if critical.

================================================================================
                        SHIFT HANDOVER CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Before Shift End:
□ Resolve or reassign all your activities
□ Add notes to ongoing incidents
□ Upload any pending evidence
□ Brief incoming shift on:
  - Unresolved activities
  - Patterns observed
  - Equipment issues
  - Special instructions

Shift Start:
□ Review pending incidents queue
□ Check unresolved activities
□ Read previous shift notes
□ Verify equipment status
□ Confirm communication channels

================================================================================
                        EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
================================================================================

SYSTEM DOWN:
1. Switch to manual logging
2. Use radio for coordination
3. Document on paper forms
4. Input when system returns

MASS CASUALTY EVENT:
1. Create single MEDICAL activity
2. Mark as CRITICAL
3. Add "MASS CASUALTY" to title
4. System auto-notifies all supervisors
5. Follow emergency response plan

ACTIVE THREAT:
1. Create SECURITY-BREACH activity
2. Mark CRITICAL
3. Add "ACTIVE THREAT" to title
4. System triggers lockdown protocols
5. DO NOT attempt to validate - auto-approves

================================================================================
                        PERFORMANCE METRICS
================================================================================

Your Performance Tracked On:
• Response time to assigned activities
• Evidence collection completeness
• Status update timeliness
• False positive rate (supervisors)
• Validation speed (supervisors)

Target Metrics:
• Acknowledge assignment: <2 minutes
• Update to RESPONDING: <5 minutes

• Validation decision: <5 minutes

================================================================================
                    REMEMBER: EVERY ACTION CREATES AN AUDIT TRAIL
                           DOCUMENT EVERYTHING - ASSUME NOTHING
