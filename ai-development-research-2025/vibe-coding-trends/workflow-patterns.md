- Social features for sharing achievements
Let me start with the core workout tracking..."
```

#### Layer 3: Implementation Details
```markdown
User: "For the exercise database, include muscle group targeting 
and equipment requirements"

AI Response: "I'll enhance the exercise database with:
- Muscle group categorization (primary/secondary)
- Equipment requirements (bodyweight, dumbbells, machines, etc.)
- Difficulty levels and progression suggestions
- Custom exercise creation for users
Implementing the enhanced database structure now..."
```

### The Problem-Solution Bridge Pattern

#### Problem Definition Phase
```markdown
User: "Users are abandoning their shopping carts"

AI Exploration:
- "What stage of checkout do users typically abandon?"
- "Are there specific error messages or friction points?"
- "How does the current flow compare to competitor sites?"
- "What user feedback have you received about checkout?"
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
```markdown
AI Analysis:
- Reviews checkout flow code
- Identifies potential UX friction
- Analyzes form complexity
- Examines error handling

AI Findings:
- 5-step checkout process (industry standard: 2-3 steps)
- No guest checkout option
- Multiple form validation issues
- No progress indicator
```

#### Solution Implementation
```markdown
AI Solutions:
1. Streamlined 2-step checkout
2. Guest checkout option
3. Enhanced form validation with real-time feedback
4. Progress indicator and step navigation
5. Cart abandonment email automation

Implementation Priority:
1. Guest checkout (highest impact)
2. Form improvements (quick wins)
3. Process simplification (major refactor)
4. Email automation (long-term retention)
```
